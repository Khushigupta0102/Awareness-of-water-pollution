            <h2>What is Water Pollution?</h2>
            <p>Water pollution occurs when harmful substances, such as chemicals, waste, or microorganisms, contaminate water bodies like rivers, lakes, oceans, and groundwater. This contamination makes the water unsafe for drinking, swimming, agriculture, and other uses. It harms aquatic life, disrupts ecosystems, and poses health risks to humans and animals.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Causes of Water Pollution</h2>
            <p>Water pollution is caused by a variety of human activities and natural processes. Here are the main causes:

            <h3>1. Industrial Waste</h3>
                Factories and power plants release harmful chemicals, heavy metals, and toxins like mercury and lead into water bodies.
                Thermal pollution occurs when industries discharge hot water into rivers or lakes, disrupting aquatic ecosystems.
                <h3>2. Sewage and Wastewater</h3>
                Untreated or inadequately treated sewage from households, hospitals, and industrial facilities can introduce harmful bacteria, viruses, and chemicals into water bodies.
                Urban runoff during rainfall can carry contaminants from streets and drains into water systems.
                
                <h3>3. Plastic and Solid Waste</h3>
                Plastic pollution, including bags, bottles, and microplastics, clogs rivers and oceans, harming aquatic life and ecosystems.
                Improper disposal of non-biodegradable materials causes long-term pollution as these items don't break down easily.
               
                <h3>4. Deforestation and Soil Erosion</h3>
                Deforestation leads to soil erosion, which causes sediments to wash into rivers and lakes. Sedimentation can disrupt aquatic ecosystems and water quality.
                Soil runoff from construction sites or agriculture can carry pollutants into water bodies.
                <h3>5. Climate Change</h3>
                Rising temperatures from global warming can increase water temperatures, affecting marine life and ecosystems.
                More extreme weather events, such as heavy rainfall, increase runoff, which can carry pollutants into water sources.
                Reducing water pollution requires proper waste disposal practices, regulatory controls, and community action to preserve and protect water resources.</p>

            <h2>Effects of Water Pollution</h2>
            <p>Water pollution harms aquatic ecosystems by killing fish and depleting oxygen levels. It also poses health risks to humans, spreading diseases and exposing people to toxic chemicals. Economically, it affects fisheries, tourism, and agriculture, while increasing water treatment and clean-up costs. Additionally, polluted water reduces access to safe drinking water and endangers biodiversity, leading to widespread environmental and economic consequences.
